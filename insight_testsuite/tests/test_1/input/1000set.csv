2019-03-05,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","This complaint dates back to last XX/XX/XXXX during a loan modification which was done with XXXX ( Account # XXXX ) my previous loan servicer this was after a 2 month forbearance after Hurricane Irma. They had indicated a shortage to my escrow account in the loan modification documents. I was provided different information every time I spoke on the phone with a XXXX   representative. One would say I had an overage, others would say I had a shortage. The modification documents indicated at {$1900.00} shortage. I called, I emailed and wrote letters, I requested a Escrow review of my account in XXXX and XXXX and was told one would be done. They kept delaying and I finally had to sign the Modification documents on XX/XX/XXXX under duress otherwise the Modification would be withdrawn. No review of my escrow was ever done by XXXX, I discovered what appears to be an error when I reviewed the two Escrow Disclosure statements from XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. The Escrow balance for XX/XX/XXXX shows an actual escrow balance of {$2200.00}, the next statement shows a XXXX actual balance for XXXX, a difference of XXXX when only XXXX should have been withdrawn from this account to pay for the monthly mortgage insurance. I have recently contacted by phone and email to XXXX and they have not responded. 

In XX/XX/XXXX my loan servicing was transferred to Mr Cooper ( Formerly Nationstar Mortgage. ) ( Account # XXXX ). Mr Cooper did do a escrow analysis in XXXX of XXXX. That analysis was completely mishandled and they indicate a shortage of XXXX in my account. Even though my account is currently at a XXXX deficit as of XX/XX/XXXX. Their major errors was their analysis to my Hazard insurance and Morgage insurance. They indicated the Hazard insurance was XXXX last year ( when it was actually XXXX ) and this year the correct amount of XXXX. The Mortgage insurance they again misquoted last year at XXXX ( the actual was XXXX ) and listed this year the correct amount at XXXX so they are showing a difference from last year to this year of XXXX increase. This is totally wrong. They are demanding the difference be paid in a lump sum or have my monthly payment increased to cover the shortage over a year period. I have contacted Mr Cooper by phone on  XX/XX/XXXX and was told someone would look at it but no one from their Escrow will call, just an email. I have also sent a letter stating the error. The new charges will be taking effect in XXXX so something needs to happen quickly. The simple facts are that my Hazard insurance has gone down from XXXX to XXXX. My taxes did go up from XXXX to XXXX, so the net effect of the two is only XXXX. I am already paying one shortage based on XXXX miscalculation and that was to be spread out over 5 years. 
I want both XXXX and Mr Copper to correct the errors made to my escrow account and have XXXX send the deficiency to Mr Cooper post haste. I want Mr Cooper to revise the shortage based on all of this information.

2020-04-07,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I received an email from a XXXX XXXX along with a single page attached on XX/XX/XXXX. The email read The final pay off amount for XXXX, XXXX will be {$86000.00} This information is provided by XXXX XXXX on XXXX. It was emailed from XXXX. The subject line read Re : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Payoff amount for XXXX and insurance info.The insurance info was a single page showing coverage of {$77000.00} on a single story dwelling from a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX listing my home address and XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , as registered agent. XXXX XXXX was the insured. I responded to that email disagreeing with the amount and asked for some sort of statement of accounting because XXXX XXXX was asking for more than the {$85000.00} financed and I had made payments for 5 years and 7 months consecutively. She responded with just saying no she was correct. On or around XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney In Fact for a XXXX XXXX mailed me a Notice of substitute trustee sale The notice had a sale date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX A date of XX/XX/XXXX An amount of {$95000.00} Borrower XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Collateral : All of Debtors interest in the real property legal described as : XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX according to the map and plat there of recorded in the Deed Anns Plat Records XXXX County , Texas . The Note section is blank. This is dated XX/XX/XXXX and has a file stamp of XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX County Records. XXXX XXXX never lended me any money. I was the only person providing money in the purchase of my home. I was in a TREC   contract with XXXX XXXX for my home. It was already signed by us both for the home {$85000.00} financed for 360 months no balloon payment ; until I received XX/XX/XXXX closing documents showing a balloon payment due XXXX XXXX, payments of {$850.00} every month/ {$600.00} being the house payment and the other being taxes. I am wanting to see the bank statements and escrow accounting for the time period of XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX, XXXX and the payment records for taxes, and all transfer records. And the proof that XXXX XXXX has showing {$95000.00} going from her hand to mine. I want to see the substitute trustee recorded appointment and I want to see proof of XXXX XXXX identity. I want to see the accounting for the down payment made on the property and proof she owned the property when she sold it to me. 
When I obtained legal representation and stopped the sale date, another debt collection letter came dated XX/XX/XXXX for a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. This notice contains all the same information as the previous notice except it is listing XXXX XXXX name first above XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney in fact at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX , Texas . After firing the first attorney hired after the discovery of {$21000.00} in receipts missing from my receipts of payments to XXXX XXXX a new hired attorney chose to conspire with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and in the printed emails left in my file that were my attorney and XXXX XXXX Attorney planning and executing the sale of my home they had agreed on the figures that XXXX will have the HUD 1 payoff Mr Cooper and XXXX loans paid in full their ( your, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) further states there is a first and second on this property Mr Cooper total payoff by XXXX XXXX {$47000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX payoff is {$13000.00} subtotal {$60000.00} BUT again there is language of a loan between XXXX and I in an amount said to be {$78000.00} and Mr. XXXX took the liberty of adding Attorney fees of {$5000.00} making a total of {$83000.00} these documents were emailed back and forth plan discussed of running it through the uncontested docket, signed by a judge, filed in the court records, being fully executed. But I never received any documentation of this sale. I am requesting / demanding the pay off accounting and statements and a copy of the HUD1.

Now I am needing to have the documentation and explanation of how my home was sold, if it wasnt is it fraud on the court? And AGAIN I receive another notice of substitute trustee sale dated XX/XX/XXXX this time the amounts are base amount due as maturity : {$88000.00} / unpaid principle past maturity ( 18 % ) {$34000.00} / subtotal {$120000.00} / Attorney Fees XXXX / Cost {$120.00} / Total due XX/XX/XXXX {$130000.00} It continues to read : please contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for current payoff instructions at my address above please be advised if this payment is not received by XXXX the mortgagee will exercise the rights under the loan documents and foreclose the loan at public sale, Tuesday, XXXX, XXXX at XXXX. In accordance with the federal and Texas laws regarding fair debt debt collections unless you within thirty days after receipt of this notice, dispute the validity of the debt set forth above or any portionhereof the indebtedness will be assumed to be valid. This notice is signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney for XXXX XXXX. Now I want to know how you, XXXX XXXX XXXX or and XXXX XXXX can act as an Attorney in fact and harass me for months, years inducing lawsuits when an attorney in fact is not allowed to handle assets held in trust? How can you impose a debt on me of {$130000.00} and state you will respond to my letter of validation when you did not. Mailing me copies of public record court papers and passed made up accounting graphs from your home computer is not accounting. I want to see the reasoning on how you decided I owed this last mentioned notice and the removal of trustee documents recorded. You stated in this debt collection letter you would reveal the original creaditor upon my request and you did not.I mailed to you by certified letter and I faxed you the same validation letter but you not XXXX XXXX responded until I received again a substitute trustee sale notice this time 2 in the same envelope? dated XX/XX/XXXX And XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating I owe {$130000.00} and contains debt collection language but you are threatening to sell my home ...., you already did once. On XX/XX/XXXX you sold my home to XXXX XXXX for a credit bid of {$88000.00}.? I want all tax certificates and the deed of trust back I want all XXXX XXXX XXXX accounting and I want copies of all the escrow account. I want copies of proof you owned my home when you sold it to me XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
I demand documented proof that you obtained a legal confessed judgement by me. I demand documentation of the mortgage loan you have repeatedly made demands for payment of and of the investment contract you are holding / have held me liable for that I am not a party that is the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Statue of Frauds was made to prevent the very thing you have been doing to me. See UCC at 2-201. You have made me an undisclosed third party to a loan modification ; to a contract I am not a party to. This is why you have never been able to show my payments going to a servicing company you are sending them as cash flow to the investors. You kept using the term mortgage in your debt collection letters but a note is a security as you know, this was undisclosed to me along with a disclaimer that was supposed to be in the credit application under Title 16 16 car 433.2 which says the buyer/seller takes it subject to all defenses and claims that the buyer could assert against any transferee or any buyer who buys it. But you Took it out of the loan application. So there is no holder in due course meaning you take it subject to my claims and defenses I am claiming recoupment under UCC 3-305 under UCC 3-306 I am encoring my proprietary and possession art and property interest in the note and its proceds. Also I am encoring my right to rescind the endorsement on the note. The rider XXXX XXXX made the wrap around deed of trust with modifies the conditions of payment and supplements and governs the promissory note. UCC 3-106 ( D ) it cant be negotiated instrument if it is subject or governed by extraneous documents outside the promissory note and you made it subject to an adjustable rate Ryder and a deed of trust. You can not collect an alleged debt on what you call a mortgage and sell someones property when it is not a note or a negotiable interest. It has a maturity longer than nine months making it a security. I am encoring my right to claim under UCC 3-306 the proceeds, rescuind the negotiation, and am claiming my possessionary and property right in the proceeds in the investment contract.

2019-11-15,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,"","We have already tried to contact the company with the following complaint 3 times using different avenues. In the most recent email sent, we requested that they contact us to at least acknowledge that the complaint was received. We have gotten no responses since the complaint was first filed three weeks ago. The text of the submitted complaint follows. 

To whom it may concern : We are writing to submit a formal complaint regarding the poor service that we received while working with XXXX XXXX XXXX/Closing Mark Home Loan. We are strongly considering submitting a formal complaint to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and any similar state agency in Colorado and/or California, as we feel that there were instances that pushed the boundaries of acceptable and, possible, legal behavior. 
The entire loan process with this company, from start to finish, has been unprofessional at best to downright deceptive and, potentially, life-impacting. We have been forgotten, lied to, and put into stressful situations that, frankly, should never happen. We have been through multiple account officers and underwriters, been asked to submit documents multiple times, been told falsehoods, and, upon completing closing on XX/XX/XXXX, we received letters that appeared to be informing us that we had been denied for the loan that we closed on. 
The following is a summarized narrative of the timeline from starting the prequalification process to closing on the mortgage. This timeline has been compiled based upon timestamped communication ( both written and digital ). 
We started this journey in XX/XX/2019, upon starting the prequalification process. We submitted the requested information to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( herein after XXXX )  and promptly received a response on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, we received an initial workbook which showed us the expected loan amount, down payment amount, fees, etc. The individual that we started with was extremely responsive and helpful, answering any of our questions promptly and clearly. 
We toured the community and decided that it was a good fit for us. At that time, we were given the option of looking for outside financing options or pursuing financing with the related company, XXXX ; the related financing came with builder incentives. At no point were we pressured by the sales team at XXXX to go with XXXX. However, as we had already started the prequalification process ( and the subsequent hard hit to our credit scores ) and because of the very good service we had received to date, as well as the healthy builder incentive, we signed the sales contract with the commitment to pursue the mortgage through XXXX. The contract was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, following a discussion with both the sales team at XXXX and the XXXX representative. 
On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday ), we reached out to the XXXX representative to see what the next financing steps would be, as the sales team indicated that the mortgage company would reach out to us. The next day ( a Sunday ), the XXXX representative informed us that he would be running an automated approval and would reach out if he needed additional documents. We took this to mean that our application was complete enough to start the clock and was in process. At this point, we had not been told that additional documents would be required to complete our application, just that there may be a need for additional documentation. 
We did not hear back from the XXXX representative after that point. On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday, nearly two full calendar weeks from last contact ), we reached out to the XXXX representative again. By XX/XX/XXXX ( Wednesday ), we emailed the XXXX sales team for assistance ; they referred us to the president of the mortgage company. We were informed, by the president of the company, that the XXXX representative that had been handling our application had abruptly left XXXX and that our application had not been passed onto another case manager/loan officer. By that time, our required loan approval date had passed ; this date was stipulated in our sales contract. 
We were connected with a new XXXX representative ( herein after referred to as new XXXX representative or loan officer ) who informed us via email that our application was incomplete and that nothing had been processed in the intervening time. Again, we had been under the impression that our application was complete and in process since mid-XXXX. At that point, again, nearly two weeks had passed, and we did not receive a formal notification of incompleteness. 
During the subsequent document collection period, the loan officer asked we could put down another half percent, which would increase our down payment to 3.5 % of the sales price. We agreed that we could afford the extra 0.5 %, but asked if she was considering an FHA loan. She informed us that she was looking at that option. At that point, we stated that we did not want to pursue an FHA loan, but said that we would consider it if we could see all the financing options that she could offer us. We asked that we be provided with a worksheet showing all the offerings that we could qualify for, so that we could pick the option that best matched our needs. We never received a product comparison worksheet despite the written request. Additionally, we did not receive an updated worksheet showing our expected costs at this time. 

Subsequently, as we were loading additional documents into the XXXX portal when we noticed that we had a loan details section available. We opened that section of the webpage and saw that our loan had been started under an FHA program, despite the fact that we had told our loan officer that we did not want an FHA loan and despite the fact that we had not been given a worksheet showing our product options. We communicated to the loan officer that we emphatically did not want the FHA loan, as the fees associated with the loan would negate any benefit from going with XXXX, based upon the builder incentives. Additionally, both of us have strong credit scores and did not need the credit support to qualify for a mortgage. Instead of giving us a workbook showing us our different financing options, the loan officer changed the product type for the mortgage to a XXXX  XXXX  conventional loan. Again, at no point were we allowed to select our product type ( or informed that XXXX only offered a limited product selection ). We were not given the information needed to make an informed decision. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the first set of loan disclosure documents ; we were not talked through our product choices at this point. We promptly signed the loan disclosures, after saving a copy and reviewing in detail. At this point, we received our first estimate ( aside from the prequalification estimate provided in XXXX ) that showed our expected loan costs, rate, fees, etc. This information was not provided ahead of time and we were informed that we had only 72 hours to sign the documents. We were not given options on product type or any other factor. Additionally, we were not offered any assistance in understanding the documents that we were given or any help working through the legalese. 

It should be noted that we were informed, only by the disclosures, that the PMI would not be cancellable due to rising home values. At the outset, the original XXXX  representative implied ( though, notably, did not explicitly state ), that the home could be reappraised after a period of time and the new value used for the LTV calculation. Under the subsequent disclosures, it was apparent that the PMI could only cancellable via loan payments compared to the original appraised value at closing. While not a major issue, it is notable because it is contradictory to information that we had at outset. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an automated email informing us that we had updated disclosures to sign. The email did not indicate what the changes were, nor did the loan officer notify us at any point that changes had been made. Upon reviewing the disclosures, the changes were the addition of a TILA form ( that we did not receive in our original packet ), an additional {$200.00} fee, and the removal of our {$5000.00} earnest money deposit. As a result, our updated disclosures indicated that we would owe an additional {$5000.00} in cash for our down payment at closing.

We reached out the same date to the loan officer and received a response that equated to her not knowing what was going on. Upon further research, she informed us that she wasnt sure why the earnest money deposit was removed and that she would make sure that we would get updated documents showing the amount. We were told to be confident that the credit would be given at closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we were introduced via email to a loan processor ( herein after loan processor or underwriter ; this introduction came directly from the loan processor and the loan officer was not involved in the introduction. At this time, the loan processor stated that our loan was conditionally approved, dependent upon two document lists. One list was to be provided as soon as possible, while the other was due within 60 days of closing. At this point, we were at about a month and a half out from the point at which we had been originally led to believe that our application was complete.

Many of the documents requested at this time had already been submitted as part of our original loan package or the subsequent package initiated by the loan officer. We had to resend many of the documents and enter them onto an online portal. 

It should be noted, at this point, we sent images ( pictures ) of several of the documents to the loan processor. This was not an issue and she did not request that the documents be scanned or otherwise in a different format. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we began reaching out to the loan officer to get information for the mortgagee clause, as our insurance agent was requesting it before he could start the formal application and estimate process on his side. The next day, we were informed that a new loan processor ( different from the current underwriter ) would provide that information to our agent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we reached out to the loan processor, as we had not heard from her since we submitted our documents ( largely completed in XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, she responded and said that she received all our documents that that everything looks good at this time. She said that she would reach out closer to closing, but did not state why. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the loan officer informing us that XXXX had acquired Closing Mark Home Loans ( herein after CMHL ) and that our mortgage application would be acquired by CMHL. The email stated that our mortgage would be redisclosed and that we would need to sign updated disclosures. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a notification from CMHL stating that the XXXX mortgage application had been migrated to the new platform. We received new loan disclosures at that time. 

The XX/XX/XXXX letter informed us that we would be receiving an updated conditional approval. This is a month after we had originally been conditionally approved. The loan officer did not reach out to explain that a new application had been started on the new platform, hence the approval process was started over entirely. The document informed us that our application was started XX/XX/XXXX, though it was not explicitly made clear that it was a completely new loan application and not just a formality due to the new system. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the formal scheduling request for closing, via Closing Mark Settlement Services. While this was scheduled, we had not yet received a formal approval, final disclosures, or closing instructions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received 3 options for the interest rate lock. The option sheet was sent only with instructions to look at Options 1, 2 and 3, with no explanation for the calculations, differences, or any other factors. Upon reviewing them, the only option that we could follow the math on was Option 3. Given the previous difficulties in obtaining information from the loan officer, we decided to lock on the option that we could follow. Based on our math, the other two options did not appear to conform to standard amortization at the listed interest rates, but, again, we could not follow the math. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received our updated disclosures for the interest rate lock. This disclosure, like previous disclosures, did not have any charge for points. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the president of the mortgage company. This email informed us that XXXX was legally required to close out the application and that we would soon be receiving a notice from XXXX  that would show that XXXX  no longer had an active application in the system for us ; the email stated that the communication that we would receive could include language stated that the application was denied, but that it would not impact our ongoing application with CMHL. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a Changed Circumstance letter. This letter added a {$770.00} fee, amounting to 0.25 % of the loan amount, as points, as part of the origination costs. This fee was not explained to us. The letter stated that it was due to the credit report/credit score and credit report/mortgage insurance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email titled XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Conditional Loan Approval. This email included a list of new documents to provide, including new disclosures, new bank statements, new paystubs, insurance quote, and college transcripts. It should be noted that we were told, in the body of the email, that the documents needed to be provided asap. At this point, we were not offered a secure way to send our documents. We could email them back to the loan processor directly or fax them. 

At this point, we were also informed that we could not send pictures of documents to the loan processor, despite having been able to send images previously. While navigable, this put a fair amount of undue pressure on us, as we had to find a way to scan our documents to be able to send them via email. We also found that we had a significant amount of pressure from the loan processor to provide the documents quickly On XX/XX/XXXX, we received disclosures to sign. On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed the loan officer and asked if the disclosures were the final set and if the listed cash to close amount was the amount we needed to get our cashiers check for closing. We were informed that the disclosures given were the final set. 

The XX/XX/XXXX documents additionally included a waiver for the receipt of the appraisal within the timing required by ECOA section 1002.14 ( a ) ( 1 ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the appraisal on the property. This property appraisal had been completed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed our loan officer to ask about what name to put on the cashiers check for closing, as we never received closing instructions. While this email was sent on a Saturday, we had previously received prompt responses from all parties, even on weekends. We had no reason to believe that we would not hear back prior to closing on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We received no further communication from the mortgage company, nor any of its agents, prior to closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we closed on the mortgage. Our appointment to close was at XXXX. We arrived at approximately XXXX, as our previous meeting for the day had ended more quickly than expected. We were prepared to wait until XXXX. Our closing agent came out at around XXXX and told us that our application had not yet been approved by CMHL and that she was, as a result, still, waiting for documents. She also informed us that she had not yet received the final closing disclosure and that, as a result, our cash to close amount had not yet ben finalized. 

At about XXXX, our closing agent informed us that she had received several closing disclosures for our application that day. She then stated that the final closing amount had been set by CMHL, as she had confirmed the most recent disclosure with the wire processor. We were short on our original check ( which was stated as the final amount, as previously noted ) and were forced to go back to our bank. We had to come up with about {$800.00} on the spot to be able to close. At this point, our closing documents were not yet available. 

We signed our documents at our XXXX PM on XX/XX/XXXX. We waited at the settlement office until nearly XXXX XXXX for the final wire to be sent by the processing agent. We were given no explanation for the significant wait. 

After closing, we returned to our then-current residence for the night. We checked our mail. We found two letters which were mailed to us ( one for each of us ), which stated that our loan had been denied. The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, but had not been mailed and post-marked until XX/XX/XXXX. These letters were related to the hand-off from XXXX to CMHL. As previously noted, we had been told in XXXX that we may receive a formal denial letter, due to the new application being opened. As given by the discrepancy between the letter and postmark dates, it appears that these letters were held back for some reason. The reason was not given to us at any point in the application process. 

The following day, XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from our loan officer apologizing for the delay in response to our question regarding our closing and a statement that she hoped our closing went okay. No comments were included regarding the fact that our loan had not been approved for the day of closing. We did not respond. 

In summary, the entire process was fraught and full of miscommunications and a lack of communication. Our grievances are summarized below : Our application was forgotten by the mortgage company, as the original representative left and nobody picked up his caseload. 
Our application was implied to have been complete and in process with the original representative. 
o At no point did we receive a formal notice of incompleteness, despite ongoing requests for information over several months. 
o We were not given a complete checklist of all the information that we would need to provide throughout the life of the application and approval process. 
We were not given product comparisons between available options, despite multiple requests for such information. 
We were originally put into a product type that we explicitly stated that we did not want. 
o While we do not know the details of the XXXX/CMHL compensation structure, we have been informed by multiple individuals from outside financial institutions that FHA loans often generate a larger incentive fee for the loan officer. We believe that this could be the reason for the initial assignment.

We were given contradictory information throughout the process. This includes receiving documents which did not include {$5000.00} in cash we had already paid ; while this was resolved, this issue was never explained to us.

We were not given explanations for multiple adjustments and changes to fees and amounts through out the process.

o Our loan officer did not make any attempt to explain any of the forms, procedures, or documents that we received. We were forced to make our best attempt at understanding the files that we had to sign. 
o When setting our rate lock, the loan officer did not explain the difference between the given options. As previously stated, two of the options did not mathematically calculate to the payments given.

o We are better informed than most consumers, as one of us works for a commercial bank. Even then, we had trouble with some of the documents and it is baffling that we received no guidance from the loan officer.

We were denied a secure way to send documents to the loan processor.

o Additionally, a format which had previously been acceptable for files, was no longer acceptable. We were not given an explanation for this discrepancy. 
We were not given closing instructions. When we reached out for instructions ( admitted at the 11th hour ), we did not receive a response. This is out of line with prior behavior, as we had previously received prompt communication even outside of normal business hours. 
o The response from the lender was given a business day after our closing. It should be noted that this response did not include any of the requested information. 
Our loan was not approved prior to the day of our closing and, in actuality, we had to wait for the application to be approved and for documents to be prepared and sent to our closing agent. 
o While we are not sure of the industry standard for loan approvals and preparation of loan documents for mortgages, it does not seem unreasonable to expect that the process should be completed well prior to the day of closing. 
o This caused a significant amount of personal stress, as our closing agent could not give us an expected timeline. We were left unaware of if we were going to be able to close on our scheduled date or if we would need to be rescheduled. 
This is significant, as we had already made arrangements for our moving process, including cancelling our lease with our prior residence, booking and prepaying for moving equipment, and taking time off from work ( including taking time for the day of closing itself ). 
We received a formal loan denial after our closing, with the denial letters being sent on XX/XX/XXXX. Given that XX/XX/XXXX was a holiday, it seems likely that the letters were sent so as to not be received until after closing. 
o The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, which means that the letters were held back for well over a month. While we are not sure on the required disclosure timelines for consumer loans, we have been informed that it is often 10 days from the decision date. This delivery falls well outside of that window.",,"ClosingMark Financial Services, LLC",CO,802XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-11-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3439091

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,327XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-10-24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3416197
2019-02-20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","Last year, we had two significant hailstorms, and my house required substantial repairs. My insurance company paid for the repairs but required my mortgage company to co-sign on my check. I sent them three checks valued at : {$1400.00}, {$2800.00}, and {$23000.00}. They withheld 10 % of the total value of my claim ( {$4700.00} ) until the work was 90 % complete. They must inspect all work before they disperse portions of your insurance check.

I reached out to Ditech via a email ( after being told to do so via phone representative ) request to remove my PMI on mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX and received no response at all from them, I even checked my junk box and nothing was there. My mortgage papers that I signed state an "" Automatic Termination of PMI '' that states once my loan is below 78 % loan to value PMI will automatically terminate ( I have attached this document ). I reached out again today on XX/XX/XXXX to make this request via phone and was told initially to send the request that I already sent it too. I asked to speak with a supervisor and after being put on hold for about 30 minutes, I finally spoke to one. They told me that my loan to value must be under 70 % loan to value and that was their policy.

My name is XXXX XXXX and I was XXXX yrs old at the time and a college student. My mom & I sat down as I returned from college and pulled my credit report. Discovered after pulling the Free Annual Credit Report that another person, XXXX XXXX  XXXX, and a car loan & credit card that were not mine were on my credit report. It should be noted it was only on XXXX. We contacted XXXX & Wells Fargo bank to report the fraudulent accounts. They did confirm it was my SS # on file but with someone elses name, DOB, and address. We filled out fraud forms, send police report number, and copies of credit reports. On XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX I received letters from both Wells Fargo & XXXX stating it was discovered to be identity theft and they would have the 3 credit bureaus remove from my credit file. I also placed a freeze on my credit files. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a few voicemails from SS office stating my identity may have been compromised yet again. I pulled credit reports again and was shocked to see XXXX  is reporting my file as XXXX XXXX XXXX, his DOB, Addresses, XXXX XXXX is running inquiries ( I dont have ), Wells Fargo credit card is showing closed as of XX/XX/XXXX, last payment XX/XX/XXXX, shows consumer disputes, and last reported XX/XX/XXXX. None of this is mine and was to be removed. 

This person is clearly using my SS # according to XXXX & Wells Fargo. XXXX did their job and removed it for Fraud. Wells Fargo has not. How did a large national bank such as Wells Fargo allow someone to open a credit card in my name without the proper verification. Clearly the other persons name and DOB ( XX/XX/XXXX ) does not match my SS #. Where is the verification on that? They allowed someone to use falsified documents and did not follow verification procedures. I am only XXXX yrs old and have been a victim of identity theft by 2 large companies.

2020-04-15,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"","I am in the XXXX  industry and have been deeply affected by the Coronavirus, likely more than most. I am a XXXX XXXX as a XXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXX. I have lost 4 months of work and have even been rescheduling in the Fall and losing my remaining good Saturdays for the year. So I will not be making up that money. I filed for unemployment, but because I am XXXX and work in 2 states ( XXXX XXXX area strattles state line ), I was told I had to call in. The call line sends you to a machine which hangs up on you after directing you back online because they are swamped. So I said I only work in Kansas in order to submit it, but no response or check yet. 

We have XXXX  kids and a new home we bought in XXXX of 2019. Our mortgage company is Mr. Cooper. We have missed 2 payments of roughly {$1800.00} each, XXXX and XXXX, so far. I have tried calling, but they also have an automated message directing you back to online and hanging up afterward. But then I discover the only option is a forbearance, admittedly warning I may be disqualified from any stimulus or other aid if I fill it out. On top of that, they say quite sternly XXXX and repeated bluntly by the CEO in a video ) that it is NOT an extension of the life of the loan, but rather a normal extension, requiring a lump sum at the end of the 90 days. As if anyone is saving money right now and able to pay MORE when this nightmare is over! Thats illogical. It is mentioned that payment plans could be made, but this is not what you agree to in the application and it is so arbitrary it is unknown exactly what they could force you to do after agreeing to this form. This seems unwise to enter into. So for these terms, and the threat of not getting aid, I chose not to fill this out. I did however email them explaining this. I have not heard back and they are still not taking calls. 

We can not lose our home. And we can not pay a higher monthly payment. We are scared and dont know how to fix this. Meanwhile, the days are passing by and notices are flooding in. We have been able to pay all our other bills, but that will end this month if unemployment or a stimulus doesnt come soon. 

If anyone can encourage mortgage companies to extend the life of loans, it would help us immensely. I can only imagine how many people are being hurt by filling out this forbearance, which essentially gives zero aid, and only allows for a little time to then make their account current all at once, without any backpay to do so. It seems dishonest and taking advantage of many people forced to choose this only option. They should be held accountable for making things worse on hurting people everywhere.",,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,KS,,,Consent provided,Web,2020-04-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3607061

This loan originated in XX/XX/XXXX. My father and I share the same name and I feel that has added confusion.

2019-03-04,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"","I am filing this complaint after receiving a letter from Chase today alleging a lie to cover up their illegal activities. In the letter ( see attachment ) dated XX/XX/XXXX Chase asserted that we cant consider you for mortgage assistance because we didnt receive your initial request by the required number of days before the scheduled foreclosure date. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE. I REPEAT. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE, AND I CAN PROVE IT! 
Chase has repeatedly made false allegations like this to us for more than four years. Most of the Chase Request for Mortgage Assistance applications we have sent to Chase have been ignored ( see attachment ). Nonetheless, In XX/XX/XXXX, our Chase dedicated relationship manager in XXXX, Florida spoke to the Chase branch bank manager and vice president in XXXX, Georgia. He ( the vice president ) told her ( our dedicated relationship manager ) that he personally faxed all of our documents to her the previous week and confirmed their receipt in her office at that time. In spite of this fact, she requested through the branch bank vice president that we submit our application and all required documents to her again for the 33rd time in 18 months ( see attachment ). Consequently, our dedicated relationship manager sent to our home address a XXXX envelope for us to submit our application and documents back to her again. We sealed the documents in that envelope and took it back to the Chase branch bank so that Chase employees could send it to her through XXXX. 
The Chase branch bank in XXXX, Georgia took receipt of our envelope of documents and gave them to XXXX. XXXX tracking confirms that our application was received by our dedicated relationship manager in her actual office on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( see attachment ). After that date, we never heard from our dedicated relationship manager again regarding ANY aspect of our application. 
Chase proceeded in XXXX to schedule a foreclosure on our property for XX/XX/XXXX in violation of the laws of our state for multiple reasons, including failure to provide proper notification as required by law. As such, this proves the statement made by Chase to us in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX is a lie because we submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance application to Chase more than thirty days before Chase took illegal action to attempt a foreclosure on the date of XX/XX/XXXX. Our "" dedicated relationship manager '' failed to process our application despite our having previously submitted it to her in XX/XX/XXXX, and well as on 32 previous occasions in the past 18 months.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,GA,305XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3169014

About a year ago I went through a separation from my children 's mother. For custody reasons she has gone out of her way to destroy my credit and career, in order to win custody of our children. She has cost me 2 jobs, by showing up and harassing me. I have evidence of this. She has opened 3 accounts in my name. If have no problem paying these if I could maintain a job. My vehicle was intentionally damaged. Sugar was poured into the gas tank. It caused over {$2000.00} in damage. She disputed 3 payments made through an account that she had used to pay with. She was listed as on the vehicle account as a driver, and on the auto insurance, which she also disputed 2 payments. After which she reported to the auto finance company the location of my vehicle and said to repo it. Then bragged about lying and what she had done one social media. I've since made the repairs using what saved money I have. I'm having troubles catching the vehicle up in order to use it as transportation to an from work. I'm a XXXX   XXXX, and can make money with or with out a job. It's just she to the personal attacks from this individual I'm currently in a circle of dept that has locked my ability to grasp how and what to do to overcome it. I need advise or help. Recently I made {$800.00} in payments to get the vehicle under 90 days past due. Toyota told me they would give me options after I did that, and vehicle would be taken out of repo status. They denyed my request to move the past due amount to the back of the dept like they agreed. Then sent a repo agent to claim the vehicle. I denyed then the vehicle. And will continue to do so. I've worked hard to buy, keep, maintain, and repair my vehicle. I'm still behind exactly what was disputed. I'm only weeks from fully financially collapsing and losing my home and everything.

Capital One chose to place a stop payment prematurely on the check and in error, they will not admit to this error plainly, will rather state "" Expectations not set correctly '' as reason for stop payment. A second check was expedited via XXXX second day air and rep ( s ) did not allow enough mail time for prior check before reissuing and thus stopping payment.. The check amount, XXXX, represents the remaining balance in my checking account ending in XXXX. Replacement check was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. I left for XXXX XXXX on this day, was not at my address to receive/sign for it or sign check itself. 

XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX picked me up, drove me to XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I have a statement from Mr XXXX stating he picked me up on said date and time. Please see attached document from Mr XXXX, he can be reached at XXXX. I was in XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. 

I received information from a XXXX with leadership team at Capital One stating said check was intercepted and signed by a XXXX XXXX whom does not live here, cashed at a XXXX XXXX XXXX which is not my account and do not bank there. A XXXX XXXX with Capital One has replied in re about this, stating the person, XXXX XXXX, lives at my address and the XXXX XXXX Bank account is or was linked to my Capital One account at some point. She also refers to a check deposited to my account from this person sometime ago. My account is now closed and It appears Capital One chose to close it due to account security, they saw the linked account, which I am not aware of, as a possible risk. It appears someone had hacked into my account at some point, added XXXX XXXX account and also used my account to cash a check in the past. Neither of these two incidents are related to loss of funds or constitute receipt of them. 

If Capital One will check signatures on check received on XX/XX/XXXX and replacement check delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, they will see signatures are different from another. Also, another check from Capital One covering overdraft and return check fees relating to stop payment shows my true and correct signature, as does the check received on XX/XX/XXXX which was deposited to my XXXX account and is now closed due to overdrawn status. The overdraft is a result of Capital One stopping payment prematurely as stated prior. I've requested Capital One check signatures, XXXX XXXX did not comply. For argument sake and figuratively speaking even if the person, XXXX XXXX, is related, does not mean funds were not stolen from me as they in fact were..

I request someone in office of the President look into this matter which has been ongoing since late XX/XX/XXXX/early XX/XX/XXXX. To avoid investigating signatures as requested, Capital One chooses to mark complaints as duplicate to avoid doing so. They requested additional time to reply to a prior complaint, which took over a month and then turned around, marked it as duplicate.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CT,06320,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3136706

2019-09-19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,328XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3379394

I then did a little research on how to have errors removed from your credit report, as well as spoke to an attorney that advised me to send certified letters to both companies asking that the accounts be verified with proof of that verification. One company ( A collection Agency ) refused the letter, the other sent me a response that said they had verified the information with the credit bureaus and was not required to provide any proof to me other than they verified my identity on this credit card ON-LINE.

2019-09-18,Debt collection,I do not know,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"On XX/XX/2019, I received the letter from Bilateral Credit Collection Company Which I have no idea who they are and there letter was written as XX/XX/2019. They were saying that I owe about {$18000.00} and respond us back urgent. They called me mulitple times and send me a letter that if i don't respond back they will treat it as confirmed debt and will make me liable. I called them and nobody picked up and i left them 2 to 3 times voicemail that please send everything in writing do not call as I am practicing the Fairness act of Debt collections. 
Anyway i send them a detailed letter as followed below in text. 

Bilateral Credit Collection XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, RI XXXX XXXX : Account No : XXXX To Whom It May Concern I do not consent to this debt and I totally dispute the validity of the debt in the above-reference account number # XXXX and would like verification from you of the obligation, the amount owed, and proof of a detailed valid assignment of the debt from the original creditor to you. I request everything to be send in written format and no phone calls or text messages. Please send me copies of all documents related to this dispute including along with the following questions answered. 
Q1 : Who you are you? Who do you represent? provide me a detailed contract copy if you are representing the original Creditor? Provide the facts and proof that you are the original representation?

Q2 : What is your direct number and what is the actual company headquarter address?

Q3 : What is your professional license information? Also are you registered in Washington state to send the dispute details as per law? As you are based out of state most probably you have to take retain local counsel?

Q4 : What was your process of getting the debt from the original creditor? what detailed information you asked or obtained? What was your verification process if it was actually a debt or a dispute? if you did not comply with the law to gather proper evidence of the claim disputes, you are already violating the law time.

Q 5 : Before sending the verification of the dispute, did you really investigated on your side what was the core issue why this all happened? 
Q 4 : Provide all the documents account records, invoices of claims and correspondence on what specific date?

Q5 : How you come up with this {$18000.00} amount and what is the breakdown of these charges?

Q6 : Based on my knowledge, Debt collectors signed a contract with the original creditor either on a commission basis or buy the debt for pretty cheap amount? By law and fairness Debt Collection Practices Act, you are supposed to provide all that information? How much was the actual amount you bought the debt or dispute for? Is there any documentation/ contract between you and the original creditor. 
Q7 : How can you seek verification and validation of the debt?

I am also exercising my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C 1692, and demand that you cease all communication except with me, my family members and all other third persons. Also you have violated the law of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, by calling multiple times on different dates to pressurize and threaten about the debt when I left a voice message and left a message to one of your agent not to call on my number. Please send me all things in written. 
You are here by notifies that if you do not comply with this request, I will immediately file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and to the State Attorney General 's Office. If you are not able to provide the answer to the above questions and proper researched verification of the dispute within 15 to 30 days of time then you are violating the FDCPA detailed Civil and criminal claims will be pursued.

I can not pay this debt as I do not consent and I do not validate this debt to be considered as a debt. I am already going through financial hardship, medical issues myself and for my family, and on top of this bilateral Credit collection continues calls and violated the law when even told not to call back that have put more pressure and created more stress environment for myself. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX They still called me and last time threaten me to take action against me and report my credit collection right away which they did not. About 2 to 3 weeks passed, then now i have received one more letter from them to call them urgently to resolve as they tried to resolve this case. First of all, I disputed and they failed to provide me with the proof and validity and their connection with the original creditor. They threaten me also voilated by calling me multiple times then it stopped but last time they called when i clearly mentioned al communication in written as my right. Then they started bashing out and said you are this and threaten to take action. funny thing is that there employees can not take control of this small small tasks, how come a company owner saying i am the owner and i do all the work lol it is funny to me, that means the workers are stupid and not capable of handling an danswering and resolving and seeing the case. Why the owner of the company will do basic paper work job and call like a customer service that is strange to me. They also have mishandling and putting false claims on other people and there are reports on betterbusiness burea. Anyway i have my proof of recording of leaving them message to just send everything in written and they still voilated it. Also I have the recording of the person who said I am the owner and i will report it right away and shut the phone and was not even listening.They need to know they have to pay for the compensation and my waste of time if they plan to drag it further. Also they need to stop this immediately otherwise I will report them.",,"Bilateral Credit Corp, LLC",WA,980XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3379164

After 5 days, it was finally straightened out. BBVA apparently had the wrong account number from my bank. I had submitted it correctly, but they kept entering one too many digits. 
However, it is because of 2-3 months of NONE payments, I believe my credit history has suffered. I have a score of XXXX, as of XXXX-18. I believe this to be unfair since it was not my error back in XX/XX/2018, when BBVA made the mistake on my loan account. I wish for this to be corrected, reviewed and addressed. Since the correction, I have been late on NO accounts and fully pay all loans and bills on time with no past due or collection agencies.",,BBVA FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CO,804XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3096980

2017-04-13,Credit card,"",Other,"","I was stupid enough to charge some items at MACY 'S on my Macy 's credit card over XXXX. I was unable to log into my account online to make the payment because Macy 's had updated the system and I simply did n't have the patience to navigate their irritating and obscure system. However, I called Macy 's and paid my bill for $ XXXX a day or two late - was assured that there would be no late charges because I was a customer in good standing, yada yada, and received a confirmation number that I had paid the bill in full. 

I then received a bill for {$2.00} in interest. OK, I agree - I had n't paid the {$140.00} on time, regardless of the reason. Whatever. So I paid that {$2.00} bill immediately, by check, and left the country for an extended absence - in complete confidence that I had paid all my bills in full. 

Imagine my surprise when I returned to the US and found that Macy 's had received and cashed my check, but charged me a further {$2.00} anyway as a minimum interest charge on the interest charge that had been paid in full, well before the due date. Oh, and then added a further minimum {$2.00} charge for a total of {$4.00}, due on XXXX. 

I called Macy 's right away and spoke to one XXXX, who did n't seem to have a clue why I was irritated, but eventually - very grudgingly and with full implication that I was a total deadbeat - agreed that she would "" waive '' the {$4.00}. 

Imagine my FURTHER surprise when I received a FURTHER email from Macy 's about my "" account balance. '' I immediately called, went through endless voice prompts, and finally got through to a live human being who said in hushed tones that she 'd have to put me through to another department. 

Sure enough, I got the "" this is an attempt to collect a debt '' speech. The glorious XXXX, according to the faultlessly polite CS rep who answered, had failed to properly credit my account. He agreed that he could correct it and that my account would update eventually to show a {$0.00} balance. However, he was unable to reassure me that this, um, "" delinquency '' had not been reported to the credit bureaux that make a darn good living off selling my info, and he could not send me a letter saying that Macy 's had made a mistake. Given that the glorious XXXX had also assured me that I had a {$0.00} balance on my Macy 's charge card, forgive me if I 'm not confident that I do in fact now have a {$0.00} balance. 

I do not give a flying whatever about my credit as I am old and cranky and do n't need any credit. I DO care that Macy 's total incompetence and the Macy 's system that is set up to fail, to their benefit and to consumers ' detriment, affects kids and other people who DO need good credit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NC,286XX,,Consent provided,Web,2017-04-13,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2432795

2019-02-20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"In XX/XX/2018 for about 10 months I made my daughter an authorized user of my account. Before doing so Barclay Card assured me that she could be a user and that it would have no impact on her credit. Only I was responsible for all charges on the account. She never signed anything. I asked for her to be added as an authorized signer to my account. BarclayCard sent her a card of her own to use. About XX/XX/XXXX she was finished with her need to use my credit card and I removed her as a user. 

She went to check her credit bureau the other day and found Barclay Card to be reporting MY full balance to her credit report. She called Barclay Card and they said they could not talk with her about it since she is not a signer on the account. I called Barclay Card to have it corrected and they said that I had to submit letter, via regular mail, and all of the supporting documentation to have my daughters credit reporting reversed. 

Their fraudulent mistake is not my problem to fix. Barclay Card acknowledges that they should not be reporting on my daughters credit report. They should not have reported it to her credit bureau while she was using the card and they certainly should not be reporting it now. However, they said they will maintain the fraudulent reporting unless I write them a letter with all the required documentation to have it removed. 

This is the exact kind of bullying behavior a big bank is supposed to have stopped a long time ago. So they have made an error and now it is MY problem to fix it. Unacceptable. And Illegal. 

Barclay Card has my complaint and my daughter 's complaint by phone and now through this correspondence. If they do not correct the erroneous reporting in a reasonable amount of time I will be forced to take more serious actions regarding the fraud they have committed against my daughter. Not to mention the illegal release of information about my account to her ( she should have never known the balance of my card at anytime, ever ). 

In my conversation with two Barclay representatives on the phone this evening both confirmed that the reporting should not have occurred as she was merely an authorized user with no responsibility for the credit and that the only way I can correct a credit reporting error, even if it is completely their fault, is in writing to a mailing address with supporting documentation which includes my daughter sending them, by mail, a full copy of the erroneous credit reporting. That exposes my family to unnecessary risk.

I had XXXX XXXX also check my social to see if there were any old accounts for me, which there are/were none. I spoke to several people within XXXX XXXX 's idenitity theft and fraud units. 
I called ARA, Inc at XXXX the next day and inititally spoke to XXXX XXXX. I explained that I believed they had some bad info on me as XXXX XXXX had no record of this debt. Also, that my credit was not very good back in XXXX and that none of the credit cards that I had at that time, gave me more than {$1500.00} credit. XXXX XXXX told me that the last digit on my XXXX XXXX account number on the notice from them was incorrect. XXXX XXXX placed me on a brief hold to 'verify this info ', and another woman XXXX XXXX picked up. I explained all of this to XXXX XXXX like I did to XXXX and XXXX XXXX told me that the original creditor was really XXXX Bank and that the credit card was mailed in XXXX to an old residence that I did not live at in XXXX. She said that the inflated debt was due to late fees, interest, and penalties, and she stated my SS # to me and that the debt was valid and then started yelling at me. She yelled at me that they would sue me in XXXX XXXX which I lived and then hung up on me. 
I spoke to the Fraud Unit at XXXX XXXX who put me in contact with XXXX to show that some Fraud activity on my credit may appear. I made a report with XXXX and I filed a complaint with the CFPB, my next step will be to contact my XXXX and the XXXX.

On XX/XX/19, I transferred some money out. I thought I already passed 90 day requirement. In XX/XX/XXXX., I contacted Capital 1 to check the bonus status.

Then I have to maintain a daily balance of {$50000.00} or more for 90 days following the initial funding period, which is 10 days. So even I have kept my daily balance above {$50000.00} longer than 90 days, I am not qualified for {$500.00} bonus. I went back to read the fine print carefully for this promotion. It states that "" Deposit {$50000.00} or more of new money from an external bank within the first 10 days of account opening. You will earn the {$500.00} bonus once youve maintained a daily balance of {$50000.00} or more for the first 90 days following the Initial Funding Period ''. It did not clearly and specifically pointed out that the initial funding period is TEN days, regardless when you funded account after opening it. I thought funding period referred to the time between opening account and funding account, as long as it is no more than 10 days. If I funded my new account on the 10th day of account opening and kept the daily minimum balance requirement for 90 days, I would have qualified for the bonus. In my case, I funded my new account on the 3rd day of account opening and kept the daily minimum balance requirement for 97 days, I am not qualified for bonus. The fine print words are very ambiguous and confusing. If it made it clear at the first place, I would have kept {$50000.00} for longer time.

I questioned him on the fact that the math on the PDF that was sent did not add up and that the principal balance was exactly the same as what I see online without the reapplied payment. If in fact they did reapply that payment then there would be a significant difference in the principal balance. I was then told that it was a programming issue and that the computer system shows different information online as to what they have in the system, I informed him that I am a computer engineer and what he is saying sounds very suspicious. I asked to speak with a supervisor who also argued with me about this imaginary reapplied payment. The PDF that was sent to me was only available to view for 45 mins then it was removed from the system.

2018-12-06,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","In XXXX I had a mortgage with Cardinal Financial Company. My mortgage at this time was escrowed for both taxes and insurance. In XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my existing mortgage through Cardinal Financial Company for a loan that did not have escrow. During my loan process the month prior my payoff was ordered. In that same month my Insurance was due to be disbursed from my escrow account. My Insurance was not paid out as it should have been as the policy renewal date was XX/XX/XXXX. I was not made aware at the time of closing or even prior that my insurance was not paid out of my escrow in XXXX and that my renewal for XX/XX/XXXX needed to be paid by me for the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX policy. This in turn caused by policy to lapse for 12mo causing me to have to purchase a worse case policy ( $ XXXX/Yr ) vs. the premium policy ( $ XXXX/Yr ) that I had. 
I reached out to Cardinal Financial Company in mid-XX/XX/XXXX once I found out my policy cancelled due to non-payment despite my account being escrowed. Initially I was told by the Insurance Department of Cardinal Financial that they did not get an invoice ( my further research found that was false as the insurance premium amount had been updated in their system to show the invoice amount for the renewal policy ). I was told that since I refinanced I should have paid it when my escrow was returned to me ( Issue with this : My insurance was due XX/XX/XXXX and I did not close on my refinance until XX/XX/XXXX - the insurance should have already been disbursed and paid by escrow ) ; I was also told when my payoff was ordered they netted my escrow from the payoff amount so all escrow payouts were froze ( I did not request this ) ; I received a letter in the mail this past week referencing my new loan and was told that their records show my insurance was good through XX/XX/XXXX and I needed to reach out to my new servicer ( False : They admitted in a conversation I had with them that they received a Notice to Cancel the day before I closed on my refinance ( XX/XX/XXXX ) - They still never said anything ) ; The last conversation I had with them they said that once a payoff is ordered they stop all escrow disbursements for 45/days and I was notified of this however could not tell me when or how I was notified ( I reviewed all of my closing docs that I signed and never signed anything about this. The only notice that was provided at close was my settlement statement that indicated I needed to cover my property expense going forward which I was aware of as I no longer escrowed ).",,CARDINAL FINANCIAL COMPANY,TN,371XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-06,Closed with explanation,No,N/A,3092493

I have never received any contact or bills forward to me. Therefore I had no knowledge of any outstanding monies. In addition, my insurance company, didn't notify me of me having a co pay of a portion of the bill that had to be covered my me. Therefore this debt is a error and if the debt is my portion of the bill, why wasn't I billed, so that the matter could be taken care of, in a timely fashion. There are guidelines in place, that require a notification period, before the medical debt can be place on the credit report.

When I called back the agents had an attitude and said I have an attorney on the case. They say each time I called the last call I made I said I had an attorney. I never told them that because I want this removed. At one point I was almost willing to settle it to have it removed for good but they did not talk to me. I have all the letters I sent out previously asking for it to be removed and have disputed it on my credit report. I am not sure what to do because i have attempted to have them validate this debt and they did not. It is for XXXX I told the credit bureaus this was happening and that they keep taking it off and putting it back on but they seem to be of no help. How do I get this permanently removed.

2018-11-03,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,"","I started a loan with with Ethos Lending ( XXXX XXXX, Ca ) on XX/XX/18 and had given them all of the information they requested and my credit scores were excellent that they used from a credit report done XXXX. Then two days before my signing date on XX/XX/XXXX, ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) they told me I would be charged a 1.099 % fee because my credit scores had dropped ( three credit agencies ) from XXXX to XXXX. I told them it was a mistake and when I called the credit agencies they told me it was because of a XXXX $ XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX bill that was unpaid. So I called XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and found out it was not my primary bill, but a secondary bill from another property and they had sent it to the wrong address, not my current address they send my other bills. XXXX XXXXXXXX sent a letter out ( which they never do ) to all three credit agencies to negate this late report. Within 15 days my credit scores all rose 80 points to back over 740.  Well I signed the paperwork in the mean time and when I went back to Ethos they said they wouldn't rebate me the fees.. 
First I think when they first ran my report to see the excellent scores and approved my loan they shouldn't be able to change that and charge me {$4900.00} two days before I sign the paperwork, just to hit me up with another charge. 
And secondly when I show they the low ratings were wrong ( shown by the letter from XXXX saying to delete this report to all three credit agencies ) and then two weeks later all three scores rose to their normally high scores they should refund me the {$4900.00} charge because the ratings were false reports ... ..

When i am finish paying this bike it would total {$14000.00}. If i would have known this i would have not bothered to take the bike.

The vehicle loan account is in me and my husbands name ; On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband went to apply for an apartment and was denied due to all the late payments that where on his credit report. According to the apartment complex, the late payments showed up on Transuion, XXXX, and  XXXX. These are the late payments that are currently on our credit report ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX to get clarification on these late payments, because according to my documents I was never 30 days late. The first person I spoke with a XXXX   over the phone was XXXX and I inquired about all the late payments that were reported to the three credit bureaus. XXXX stated, I only see that XX/XX/XXXX, has been reported to the credit bureaus. Thats when I chimed in and said, According to the credit report that the apartment complex pulled on my husband, XXXX reported these months as being 30 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ). 
XXXX stated that she has limited ability to see whats on my vehicle loan account far as payments are concerned. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor, and she stated should would be it will be a while before the supervisor would be on the call. I waited 30 mins before XXXX the collections supervisor go on the line. He introduced himself as XXXX the collections supervisor. I asked XXXX, could he tell me what late payments did XXXX report to the 3 credit bureaus because my husband had his credit report pulled by the apartment complex and was denied the apartment because of several late payments on his credit report, I explained to him me and my husband are both on the car loan. XXXX stated, I have limited visablity to you car loan account. I said, You are a supervisor and you cant tell me what 30 day late payments XXXX submitted to the credit bureaus. XXXX said, We report differently to the credit bureaus, for instance if it the XXXX and we havent received a payment by then we report you to the credit bureaus. I informed him that was illegal because by law you must be 30 days late on payments before you can submit it to the 3 credit bureaus. XXXX is giving me this illegal information on a recorded XXXX line. He instructed me to send a letter to the XXXX direct dispute department. After he gave me that information, I informed him that I would be submitting a complaint with the CFPB about these late payments and this wasnt the first time that XXXX  sent incorrect info to the credit bureaus on this car loan. 
Please remove inaccurate late payments for these months from the 3 credit bureaus ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Also is there a way from preventing the month of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from being submitted to these three credit bureaus Transuion, XXXX and XXXX.

2019-03-05,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","The escrow unit of my mortgage servicing company, Ditech, is supposed to manage and submit payments for real property tax as well homeowner 's insurance. I received my Real Property Tax Bill for the XX/XX/XXXX year from DC and the bill indicates that the real property tax for the second half of XX/XX/XXXX was never paid. Therefore there is an outstanding balance plus a penalty as well as interest. I called DC to confirm that there was indeed an outstanding balance and they calculated the numbers with me over the phone and confirmed that there is indeed a balance. They also told me that because escrow missed this payment, I could request a waiver of the penalty and interest. I then called Ditech to ask them what happened with the missed payment and to get the payment taken care of. First, they told me i received a surplus return from my escrow which has nothing to do with the outstanding tax bill. Second, they told me that Ditech did indeed make the payments. However, I told them that was not true because DC calculated the numbers and I checked the payment history from the escrow, and that payment was in fact not paid. The person i talked to insisted it was paid and tried to hang up on me and said he confirmed this with the manager. Finally, he let me speak to the manager who then put me in touch with the tax department. The tax department claims they never received the bill and said they would take my word for it to make the payment. I told them to make sure they take into account and also request the waiver of penalty and interest so there is no over-payment. They obviously were trying to get rid of me and quickly hung up. I have no confirmation that they will contact DC to get the correct amount or follow through with payment since multiple people gave me different answers. I also have no confirmation that they will request the waiver of interest and penalty fees.

Not being happy, called Wells Fargo Customer Service, spoke with XXXX, ( XXXX XXXX ) I asked to speak with a manager, he said he would if I explained my concern. I told him and he said my husband was given the correct information. I are repeated my initial request. I was transferred to XXXX. XXXX explained it was a Federal reg which all banks have to follow. I asked for the req number so I could contact my Congressman. He put me on hold and told me he was incorrect it wasn't Federal by banking policy. I asked if he knew the reason as he had explained he was in the executive section of Wells Fargo. He didn't know. He did say the reason was probably due to fraud or counterfeit. I asked he transfer me to someone in a higher position. He said there was no one higher ( I believe he said this ). I stated there is always someone higher and he transferred me to XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) I explained, she gave me generally the same answers. I asked if they suspected my husband of fraud or counterfeiting why weren't the police called. He had in had American money, not foreign from our bank. He was making a deposit into the bank, not taking any money out. He would have left any info. He was not a member of any carter or mafia. I find this utterly ridiculous. I asked for the person ( people ) who had made this policy. XXXX explained because of the banking mess ( my word, not hers ) several years ago banks made this decision. I still don't understand. She told me there isn't anyone I could speak with. So I asked for a banking commission or something. She told me of CFPB.

Due to changes in construction and weather we had come to the anniversary date on the construction loan and need the extension for 6 months. We reach out to XXXX XXXX early in the process to get it done so there was know problem with the loan. We than go the paperwork in the mail showing amount due on XXXX XXXX XXXX we were not done with the house. We reached out to XXXX XXXX about it and he said they were working on it. He would get back to us with something by the end of the week. We reach out again he said that they would have it done by early next week not to worry about it. We got the paperwork work late from them and than they put a late payment on my credit. We called XXXX XXXX about it and he said that should have not happen and he would take care of it for us.
